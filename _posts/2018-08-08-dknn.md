TLDR; Our previous [blog](https://zerobatchsize.net/2018/08/08/rawr.html) showed how interpretations can fail due to issues in relying on model confidence. Here, we fix some of the confidence issues by applying [Deep k-Nearest Neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04765) to NLP, which improves model interpretations.
