[KAR$^3$L](http://karl.qanta.org/) is a next-generation spaced repetition learning tool developed by the natural language processing lab at University of Maryland ([CLIP lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)). Unlike traditional methods where all flashcards are treated as equal and all users are treated as equal, KAR$^3$L reads the content of each flashcard and the study history of each individual user, then chooses a time to review the flashcard in order to mxaimizes the psychological spacing effect.

Since KAR$^3$L's [public launch](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&p=379140&sid=8ae602e914bc1e56736a07030176c718) on August 24th, we have seen 424 users, who in total studied over 75000 flashcards.
