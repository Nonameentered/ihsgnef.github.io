[KAR$^3$L](http://karl.qanta.org/) is a next-generation spaced repetition learning tool developed by the natural language processing lab at University of Maryland ([CLIP lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)). Unlike traditional methods where all flashcards are treated as equal and all users are treated as equal, KAR$^3$L reads the content of each flashcard and the study history of each individual user, then chooses a time to review the flashcard in order to mxaimizes the psychological spacing effect.

In this post, we summarize our first phase tests. By analyzing the study history of our users, we provide some insights into how KAR$^3$L works, its advantages over traditional methods, and where it can be improved. We'll also give a sneak peek of what's coming next.

We are happy to discuss this project. Joining our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PTfEmHd), or reach out to our team directly: [@ihsgnef](https://twitter.com/ihsgnef), [@matthewmshu](https://twitter.com/@matthewmshu), and [feet-thinking@googlegroups.com](feet-thinking@googlegroups.com).

## Where we are right now?

Since KAR$^3$L's [public launch](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&p=379140&sid=8ae602e914bc1e56736a07030176c718) on August 24th, we have 424 sign-ups, and our users studied in total over 75000 flashcards.

<div id="vis" style="width:800px; margin:0 auto;">
<script>
  const spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ihsgnef/ihsgnef.github.io/master/images/n_users_and_n_facts.json";
	vegaEmbed("#vis", spec)
    .then(result => console.log(result))
    .catch(console.warn);
</script>
</div>

To compare and contrast our model with traditional models like [Leitner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) and [SM-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo), we implemented these models  and assigned some users (selected randomly) as the control group. Below is a breakdown of the users assigned to each model, and how many studies each group contributed.

## Evaluating KARL

<script>
  const spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ihsgnef/ihsgnef.github.io/master/images/45_user_level_vs_effort.json";
	vegaEmbed("#vis", spec)
    .then(result => console.log(result))
    .catch(console.warn);

### What do we want to get out of this evaluation

### Progress vs. Effort

### How does the model predict difficulty?
